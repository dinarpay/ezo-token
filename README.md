Element Zero is a not-for-profit algorithmic stablecoin creation platform, based on a new methodology that completely eliminates the possibility for any volatility in the first place. The protocol is designed to allow a sender to send an Element Zero stablecoin to a receiver only if the receiver sends back in return a receipt, an invoice or another cryptocurrency that is equivalent to the known, fixed value of the stablecoin. Element Zero enables businesses, organizations and even governments to create their own stablecoin — FREE of Charge

WHY WILL THE CURRENT STABLECOIN SOLUTIONS NOT SURVIVE?
Stablecoins that are backed by commodities are subject to market volatility therefore, by definition, are not stable and those that peg to currency will become obsolete once governments issue their own coin.
Algorithmic stablecoins cannot predict a ‘black swan’ event and are challenged because no one can predict what kind of problems we'll have in 50 years from now
